! my dear  

this gateway was used in my workshop "internet of the things" @ NTUA TW 2010.playaround.cc

!! USAGE

copy the folder including subdirectories  twitterGateway04 AS IT IS to you processing SKETCH folder
start processing in // file / sketchbook you should see twitterGateway07
open the config pane and replace at least <YOUR_LOGIN> <YOUR_PASSWORD> with your login and password ;-)
edit the twiietr.trackwords entry with something useful eg "love hate" 
start the gateway and observe the flow ...



good luck
